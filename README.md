### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Annisa. I'm a lost Computer Science undergrad student but I get back on track since last year (HAHA, it's sad & don't judge me). Now I'm on track cuz I know what I want and my interest! (finally). I'm into Machine Learning, currently involved in Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. Besides techy stuff, I want to have opportunity in a non-profit organization (NGO) focusing in women education (especially in tech), climate change, and responsible consumption. I speak English and Indonesian, also learning Spanish and Hawaiian!

<br> Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/annisann) or [e-mail](ennoza41@gmail.com). Mucho gusto, e ka hoa!
