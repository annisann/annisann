### Hi, it's Annisa! 👋

I studied **Computer Science** at University of Brawijaya, Indonesia. I have several experiences in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and currently learning full-stack engineering! I code mostly **Python** 🐍. Currently learning **Javascript**! 🦦

Besides techy stuff, I love to be involved in volunteering projects or non-profit organization (NGO) focusing on **women education** (especially in tech), **climate change**, or **responsible consumption**. Back then, I have involved in an environmental issues NGO (2020-2021) and became international volunteer - educate and create workshops about responsible consumption and production (SDGs 12) to 7th-grader, fun!!! I speak **Indonesian** and **English**.

⚡ FuN faCtttTTTs:
- I listen a lot to emo songs, also Sum 41, Bring Me The Horizon, Sleeping With Sirens.
- I, too, listen a lot to Britney Spears, Elvis Presley, JLo, Tame Impala, Cali y El Dandee.
- Having fun by visiting art gallery, watching art performances, gokarting... Never try wall climbing, take me!
- My dream? Sky diving.. ☁️ Ocean is much more scary! LOL
- Snacks which I could eat forever?!! Lidi pedes, keripik setan... maicih & karuhun :9
