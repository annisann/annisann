### Hi, it's Annisa! üëã

I'm a **Computer Science** undergraduate student. I currently learn **Deep Learning** theory and my last project is in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** topic. I code **Python** and still struggle in OOP! ‚òπÔ∏è

Besides techy stuff, I'd love to be involved in volunteering projects or non-profit organization (NGO) which focus in **women education** (especially in tech), **climate change**, or **responsible consumption**. Back then, I have involved in an environmental issues NGO (2020-2021) and became international volunteer - educate and create workshops about responsible consumption and production (SDGs 12) to 7th-grader, my current best memory (2018)!!! I speak **English** and **Indonesian**, also learning **Spanish** and **Hawaiian**!

<br> *Mucho gusto, e ka hoa!* (re: Nice to meet you, friend!)
