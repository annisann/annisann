### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Annisa. I'm a lost **Computer Science** undergrad student but I get back on track since last year (HAHA, it's sad pls don't judge me). Now I'm on track cuz I know what I want and my interest! (finally). I'm into **Machine Learning**, currently involved in **Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects**. I code **Python** and still struggle in OOP.. Oh! and besides techy stuff, I want to involved in volunteering project or non-profit organization (NGO) which focus in **women education (especially in tech)**, **climate change**, or **responsible consumption**. Then, I have involved in a environmental issues NGO (2020-2021) and became volunteer - spread education and create workshops about **responsible consumption and production (SDGs 12)** (2018). I speak **English** and **Indonesian**, also learning **Spanish** and **Hawaiian**!
