### Hi, it's Annisa! 👋

I'm a lost **Computer Science** undergrad student but I get back on track since last year (HAHA, it's sad pls don't judge me). Now I'm on track cuz I know what I want and my interest! (finally). I'm into **Machine Learning**, currently involved in **Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects**. I code **Python** and still struggle in OOP.. Oh! and besides techy stuff, I'd love to be involved in volunteering projects or non-profit organization (NGO) which focus in **women education (especially in tech)**, **climate change**, or **responsible consumption**. Back then, I have involved in an environmental issues NGO (2020-2021) and became international volunteer - educate and create workshops about **responsible consumption and production (SDGs 12)** to 7th-grader, my current best memory (2018)!!! I speak **English** and **Indonesian**, also learning **Spanish** and **Hawaiian**!

<br> *Mucho gusto, e ka hoa!* (re: Nice to meet you, friend!)
